# ü§ñ MCP + Claude Integration

This project provides a command-line interface that connects to **MCP servers** (both HTTP and stdio) and integrates them with **Anthropic's Claude** model.  
The program allows interactive conversations with Claude, including the ability for Claude to request the execution of tools provided by MCP servers.

---

## ü™∂ Features

- Load and validate configuration from a `config.toml` file.
- Connect to multiple MCP servers (HTTP and stdio supported).
- Retrieve and expose tools from MCP servers to Claude.
- Interactive CLI interface where the user can chat with Claude.
- Claude can request tool usage, which is executed automatically.
- Chat history is stored in a `chat.log` file.
- Environment variables are loaded from `.env` (fallback to system env).
